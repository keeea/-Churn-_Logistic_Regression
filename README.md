# Logistic Regression on Credit Takers

The home repair tax credit program is a program from the Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD), which has suffered from low conversion rate, typically only 11%, for decades. The main goal of this analytic is to help the HCD to identify home owners who qualify for repair tax credit, therefore reach out to them more precisely, reducing marketing cost, and improving home value of repaired homes and their surrounding neighborhoods. To be specific, an effective classifier will be trained, and its model results will assist to inform a cost/benefit analysis.
